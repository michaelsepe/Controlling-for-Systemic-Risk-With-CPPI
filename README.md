# Controlling-for-Systemic-Risk-With-CPPI

(THIS IS AN INDEPENDANT PROJECT)

Here I use market returns, size, and number of firms by industry to reveal how the market can be exposed
to systemic risk permiating through multiple industries at once. 

Using a rolling window of correlation between industries and returns, I impliment a CPPI (Constant Portfolio Performance Insurance)
algorithm to my assests distribution between risky and risk free.

Ultimatley I was able to show the advantages of using an adaptive approach to assest allocation in order to 
minimize exposure to systemic risk beyond ones personal apetite for risk.

I wrote this code alongside the teachings of coursera's Introduction to Portfolio Construction
